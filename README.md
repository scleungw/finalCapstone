1. amount of money that they are depositing.
2. The interest rate (as a percentage)
3. The number of years they plan on investing.
4. “simple” or “compound” interest

If the user selects ‘bond’, the program will ask the user to input:

● The interest rate. 
● The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond.

The program will then print out the answers
